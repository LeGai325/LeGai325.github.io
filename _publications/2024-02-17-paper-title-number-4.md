The project implements and optimizes the national cryptographic algorithms  on a domestic RISC-V platform, achieving both software and hardware  acceleration. It optimizes the critical computational steps of bilinear  pairing and elliptic curves at the instruction level, designs  cryptographic processing units for point multiplication and modular  exponentiation respectively, and ultimately accelerates the computation  of the national cryptographic algorithms.
