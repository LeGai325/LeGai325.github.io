# Projects
## **Open-Source Projects**: 



## **Research Projects**: 

**A Safe and Efficient Speech Recognition System for Vehicle Machines Based on Federated Learning (National Innovation Project):** The FedAsr project introduces a secure speech recognition framework for the Internet of Vehicles using federated learning, combining deep neural  networks with CTC-CNN acoustic models and Markov language decoders. It  employs lightweight homomorphic encryption for privacy, reducing  overhead. FedAsr enhances accuracy by 10%, cuts latency by 15.8%, and  supports decentralized training, improving efficiency and security.

**Fast Cryptographic Algorithms Based on RISC-V Processing Cores(Shaanxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology):** The project implements and optimizes the national cryptographic algorithms  on a domestic RISC-V platform, achieving both software and hardware  acceleration. It optimizes the critical computational steps of bilinear  pairing and elliptic curves at the instruction level, designs  cryptographic processing units for point multiplication and modular  exponentiation respectively, and ultimately accelerates the computation  of the national cryptographic algorithms.

**Feature Engineering-based Ransomware Detection Methods(Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission):** This project plans to implement PE analysis and ransomware feature extraction and use machine learning classification algorithms such as LightGBM, XGBoost, and SVM to design a static detection method based on deeply reflecting the behavioral characteristics of ransomware.
